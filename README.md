Thanks for Aschin for helping and many greatful advices.

Feel free to rewrite it into your language, just need to mark my name on it and let me know.

You only need to rewrite the arrays in '#region Block' and Grass_Path and Grass in 'sortItem()'.
You can also change the sort logic in the 'sortItem()' if needed.
